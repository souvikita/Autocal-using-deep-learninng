abstract = {Abstract The Sun-Earth Lagrangian L5 point is a uniquely advantageous location for space weather research and monitoring. It covers the “birth-to-impact” travel of solar transients; it enables imaging of solar activity at least 3 days prior to a terrestrial viewpoint and measures the solar wind conditions 4–5 days ahead of Earth impact. These observations, especially behind east limb magnetograms, will be a boon for background solar wind models, which are essential for coronal mass ejection (CME) and shock propagation forecasting. From an operational perspective, the L5 orbit is the space weather equivalent to the geosynchronous orbit for weather satellites. Optimal for both research and monitoring, an L5 mission is ideal for developing a Research-to-Operations capability in Heliophysics.},

In this paper, we show how to learn a mapping from EUV narrowband images to spectral irradiance measurements using data from NASA{\textquoteright}s Solar Dynamics Observatory obtained between 2010 to 2014. We describe a protocol and baselines for measuring the performance of models. Our best performing machine learning (ML) model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperforms other ML models, and a differential emission measure (DEM) based approach, yielding average relative errors of under 4.6\% (maximum error over emission lines) and more typically 1.6\% (median). We also provide evidence that the proposed method is solving this mapping in a way that makes physical sense and by paying attention to magnetic structures known to drive EUV SSI variability.},

Many of the definitions explain ANN by referring to graphics instead of giving well explained mathematical definitions; therefore, misleading weighted graphs (as in minimum cost flow problem networks) fit the definition of ANN. This study aims to give a clear definition that will differentiate ANN and graphical networks by referring to biological neural networks. The proposed definition of ANN is a mathematical definition, from the point of graph theory which defines ANN as a directed graph. Then differences between ANNs and other networks will be explained by examples using proposed definition."

But under the orbital thermal and vacuum environment, organic materials can outgas and the outgassed products and induced environment often degraded performances of spacecraft or its subsystem. In this article, the typical impacts of outgassing environment on spacecraft are explained briefly. Then the outgassing theory, test method, identification of compounds and control measures were reviewed in detail. The need for transient and long-term outgassing model is discussed. The standard test methods of E595 and E1559 are compared. The promising new techniques such as infrared spectrometry and/or mass-spectrometry with thermogravimetric analysis is proposed for the identification of outgassed compounds. The vacuum bakeout and molecular absorber for outgassing control are reviewed and for the last more research work is needed.}
